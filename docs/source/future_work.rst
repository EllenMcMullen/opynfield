future work
===========

I welcome feedback on how to make opynfield more useful! Please contact me with suggestions.

Features I am currently working on:

*   Create an 'other' input format (.csv of time and x and y coordinates) for non-standard or uncommon data sources
*   Change the method of specifying the model settings to make it easier to use non-default values
*   Create more gradations in the ''verbose'' setting so that users can choose which types of progress updates they want to see

Backend checks I am working on:

*   Increase test suite
*   Assess time bin size assumptions
